= Opening a Saved Style Library

There are three ways in which you can open a saved Style Library. You can use the Open Style Library... menu item from the File menu or, if you recently used a Style Library, it will show up in the Most Recently Used section of the File menu as well as the Open Recent section of the Start page.
