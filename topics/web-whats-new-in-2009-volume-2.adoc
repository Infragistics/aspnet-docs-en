= What's New in 2009 Volume 2

The Infragistics ASP.NET 2009 Volume 2 release includes a collection of new controls built on the Infragistics ASP.NET AJAX framework.

== New AJAX Indicator

The new AJAX Indicator feature provides a way to display a message to the end user while they are waiting for a response on an AJAX call. The indicator will show itself when a control initiates an AJAX call, and automatically hides itself once the server response completes on the client.

By default, a shared AJAX Indicator exists for all Infragistics™ AJAX controls along with common property settings. You can also configure the indicator on each control individually and you can also also configure it globally for an entire application through the web.config file. Settings applied from the control level or through the web.config file will have priority over the shared AJAX indicator settings.

The AJAX Indicator is completely customizable. Some of the important customizations available are listed below:

* Enabling and Disabling the Indicator.
* Setting the location for the Indicator, either relative to the page or to a specific control.
* Disable or grey out a control or the entire web page during an AJAX call.
* Assigning Image or Text for the wait message during an AJAX call.

The following Infragistics™ AJAX controls support the new AJAX Indicator.

* WebDataGrid™
* WebDataTree™
* WebDropDown™
* WebHierarchicalDataGrid™

== New WebHierarchicalDataGrid Control

The new WebHierarchicalDataGrid™ control allows you to display hierarchical data. It derives from the WebDataGrid™ control and has many related features. WebHierarchicalDataGrid can be bound to a multi level data source with multiple child bands on a single level.

All the functionalities for a flexible, feature-rich grid control are present in WebHierarchicalDataGrid.

The following list shows some of the WebHierarchicalDataGrid features:

* *Hierarchical Data Source Support* – Supports all hierarchical data source controls as well as Dataset objects and objects that implement the IEnumerable interface.
* *AJAX Enabled* – You can fully enable AJAX in the control for smoother data retrieval and unobtrusive data operations.
* *Client-Side Object Model* - Dynamically work with the control on the client-side using the expansive JavaScript API.
* *Autogenerate Bands and Columns* - WebHierarchicalDataGrid can optionally walk through your hierarchical data to automatically produce bands and columns.

* *Templates* - Most of the elements in WebHierarchicalDataGrid can be templated allowing for maximum flexibility and customization.

== New WebDataGrid Column Fixing

The WebDataGrid™ control now supports Column Fixing. Your end-users can now fix columns within the grid area; this operation is performed on the client. The fixed columns will remain visible at all times within the grid even when the end-user scrolls the grid horizontally.

Column fixing also comes with several UI enhancements that allows you to customize the following options:

* Hide/Show push pin buttons on column headers for all or individual columns.
* Align button to left or right of the caption.
* Fix columns to the left or right of the grid.

== New WebDataGrid Virtual Scrolling

The WebDataGrid™ control now supports Virtual Scrolling which allows it to send partial amounts of data records to the client, and request additional data records on demand as the end-user scrolls through the control. The Virtual Scrolling behavior therefore greatly improves performance by allowing the end-user to navigate through large volumes of data without having to send the entire data source to the client.

The virtual scrolling behavior works in two different modes: Virtual mode allows for visible scrolling of rows; When an end-user drags the scrollbar, within the row cache, the scrolling is smooth and visible. With deferred scrolling there is no moving of rows when scrolling. WebDataGrid displays a tooltip next to the scrollbar displaying the row number that will be loaded when the user scrolls. When the end user stops scrolling, rows in that scroll region are displayed in the view port.

== New WebDataGrid Column Hiding

The WebDataGrid™ control now allows you to hide a column you do not want to display to your end-users. For example, you may not want to show columns that are meaningless to your end-users. You can easily hide a column through the designer or programmatically either from the server-side or the client-side.

== Updated Editor Providers and Default Editors for WebDataGrid

WebDataGrid™ now uses the following Editor Providers based on the new lightweight ASP.NET AJAX editor controls thus leading to the next step in the evolution of today's WebEditors:

* CurrencyEditorProvider
* DatePickerProvider
* DateTimeEditorProvider
* MaskEditorProvider
* MonthCalendarProvider
* NumericEditorProvider
* PercentEditorProvider
* TextEditorProvider

The new Editor Providers give you more enhanced functionality so that you can have more powerful data entry applications.

== Default Editors

On an editing-enabled WebDataGrid control, the most appropriate editor provider will be used on each column depending on the column's data type. For example, numeric and DateTime data type columns will automatically use the Numeric EditorProvider and the DateTimeEditorProvider respectively. However, if you wish to override this default functionality, you can always specify your own editor provider(s).

== New WebDataTree Disable Auto-Checking

WebDataTree™ now has a new feature that allows you to disable auto-checking of checkbox tree nodes. For example, when an end-user checks a child node in WebDataTree, its parent node (if unchecked) becomes partially checked (TriState CheckBoxMode) or fully checked (if all the child nodes are checked), or if a parent node is checked, all its child nodes are also checked. However with the disable auto-checking feature you can stop the tree nodes from being checked for those scenarios in which this behavior is not needed.

== New WebScheduleGenericDataProvider Component

The WebScheduleGenericDataProvider™ component allows you to bind the WebSchedule™ controls to any supported data sources. This addition of the WebScheduleGenericDataProvider component gives you more flexibility in choosing WebSchedule data sources; you no longer need to rely on just the SqlDataProvider or the OleDbDataProvider for data binding.

== Supported Data Sources

The following is a list of WebScheduleGenericDataProvider's supported data sources.

* DataSet and DataTable
* IListSource
* IDataSource
* IEnumerable (read-only, updates must be IList or ICollection)

== New WebSchedule Multi Day Event Banner

The WebDayView™ and WebMonthView™ WebSchedule™ controls can display a continuous banner for events that span multiple days, weeks, months, or years. The WebScheduleInfo™ component's link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webschedule.webscheduleinfo~enablemultidayeventbanner.html[EnableMultiDayEventBanner] property controls this feature, which is True by default. If EnableMultiDayEventBanner is set to false, a multiple day event displays as single blocks across multiple days.

You can also display arrows indicating the start and end dates that the event spans, by setting the link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webschedule.webscheduleinfo~enablemultidayeventarrows.html[EnableMultiDayEventArrows] property, which is True by default.

== New WebSchedule Multi Resource View

The WebSchedule™ controls (WebDayView™ and WebMonthView™) allow you to display scheduling information from multiple resources. To enable multiple resource view, set the WebScheduleInfo component's link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webschedule.webscheduleinfo~enablemultiresourceview.html[EnableMultiResourceView] property to True.

== Overlay Mode

Overlay mode allows your end users to see scheduling information for different resources in one view; the active resource displays with a unique style to distinguish it from the inactive resources. For information on customizing the styles for active and inactive resources, see link:webschedule-styling-active-and-inactive-resources.html[Styling Active and Inactive Resources].

A tab control allows you to switch between the different resources. Set the link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webschedule.webdayview~enablemultiresourcecaption.html[EnableMultiResourceCaption] to True or False to control this behavior.
