= Set the Active Day

The WebScheduleInfo™ control's  pick:[asp-net="link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webschedule.webscheduleinfo~activedayutc.html[ActiveDayUtc]"]  property represents a single date used as a point of reference and focus within the user interface. As such, the ActiveDayUtc is rendered by WebCalendarView™ and WebMonthView™ using a specific style that highlights that date and makes it more noticeable to the user.

As different dates are clicked within WebCalendarView and WebMonthView, the ActiveDayUtc property is changed accordingly.

On the other hand, WebDayView does not reflect changes to the ActiveDayUtc within its user interface and also does not effect changes to the ActiveDayUtc as different day areas are clicked.

The code below sets the WebSchedule controls to load with October 3, 2005 as the active day.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If you are creating a new  pick:[asp-net="link:{ApiPlatform}webui.shared{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.shared.smartdate.html[SmartDate]"]  and are not assigning a time to it you need to use the  pick:[asp-net="link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webschedule{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webschedule.webscheduleinfo~converttimezonetimetoutc.html[ConvertTimeZoneTimeToUtc]"]  method off the WebScheduleInfo.
