== Cell Merging Overview

=== Introduction

Cell merging enables you to sort or group data within the  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_   and display that data with cells containing the same values merged into a single cell. The cells only appear merged; the grid structure is not affected by the use of this function. Cell merging works with both the link:webhierarchicaldatagrid-sorting.html[sorting] behavior and link:webhierarchicaldatagrid-about-outlook-groupby.html[grouping] settings of the  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_ .

The following screens illustrate an unmerged display (Figure 1) and a merged display (Figure 2). As you can see the merged display below (Figure 2), has sorted the records, gathering those records with the same region and displaying region as a single merged cell with one instance of the cell’s data.

|====

By default, Cell Merging is disabled. Refer to the topic, link:webhierarchicaldatagrid-enabling-cell-merging.html[Enabling Cell Merging] for information on enabling this feature.

=== Supported Cell Merging behaviors

Cell merging can be independently enabled or disabled for either sorting behavior or grouping settings. A detailed explanation of how cell merging impacts each of these follows.

=== Cell Merging on sorting

The following screen shot illustrates how the data of a sorted  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_   appears with Cell Merging enabled.

A close inspection of <<_Ref320880084,Figure 3 - Examples of Sort with Cell Merging Enabled>> reveals the effects of using the  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_   _’s_   sorting behavior with Cell Merging enabled. In the sorting example, the sort criteria is for records where Country = ‘USA’, as you can see records meeting these criteria appear clustered together at the top of the grid.

=== Cell Merging on grouping

The following screen shot illustrates the effect of  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_   _’s_   group setting with Cell Merging enabled.

As you can see the country column contains values representing different countries, in this case the  __UK__  and  __USA__ . When displayed, the records are grouped by country where the value within the country cells has the same values, as in this example records belonging to either the  __UK__  or the  __USA__  are visually merged with other records belonging to the same country. Additionally, note that a row appears before the grouped records identifying the item grouped, its value and a record count. In this case Country, UK and USA with 4 and 5 records respectively.
