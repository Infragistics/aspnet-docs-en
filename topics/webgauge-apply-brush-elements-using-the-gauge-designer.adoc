= Apply Brush Elements Using the Gauge Designer

In the Appearance tab of the Gauge Designer, the left drop-down list is populated with the available brush types. Depending on which brush type you select, the adjacent drop-down list will populate with the color properties available for the selected brush type.

There are various brush elements available through the Gauge Designer. Specifying the brush type and its color allows you to dramatically change the look and feel of your property. Using the Appearance Tab, you can easily change the brush type and color of the property that is currently selected.
