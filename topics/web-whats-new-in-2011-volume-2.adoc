== WebDataGrid Multi-Column Headers

The WebDataGrid now supports multi-column headers where multiple levels of headers can be configured in the grid and data columns can be grouped into parent headers. The multi-column behavior works well with column resizing, column moving, sorting, and filtering.

[[Four]]
== WDG-WHDG Batch Updating

Batch Update mode of the Editing Core Behavior allows you to modify, either update, insert or delete rows, without going to the server on every row editing. All the data is edited on the client and it is persisted on the server on the first postback. The main features of the Batch Update mode are:

* Modify more than one row at a time
* Undo the modified data before sending it to the server
* Dynamic recalculation on the client if there are summaries enabled
* Client-side events
* Using server events for updating, adding and deleting rows
