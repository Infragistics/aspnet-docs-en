= About WebDateTimeEditor

Like all Infragistics ASP.NET AJAX controls, WebDateTimeEditor seamlessly integrates into the Infragistics® Application Styling Framework. With CSS based properties you can manually customize the WebDateTimeEditor by leveraging your existing style sheets.

WebDateTimeEditor also exposes a robust model within the client-side Javascript programming environment. The client-side object model (CSOM) consists of full-fledged properties and methods that enable developers to program significant units of functionality without the need of server-side postbacks.

Some of the WebDateTimeEditor control’s features include:

* *High-Performance* -- Lightweight markup and optimized code improve performance.
* *Spin Buttons* -- End-users can easily spin through a list of values.
* *Standard Validators support* -- Supports ASP.NET validator controls.
* *Min and Max values* -- You can easily specify the allowable range of dates/times that can be entered into the editor.
* *ReduceDayOnInvalidDate* -- If the end-user enters a value which is greater than the maximum day in the month, then the value can be automatically reduced.
* *ShowPatternOnFocus* -- In edit mode, the displayed string (input pattern) can be built dynamically with cut-off prompts and literal characters on the right side of the caret.
* *SelectionOnFocus* -- You can set different selection types for whenever entering edit mode.
* *Culture* -- You can set the CultureInfo object used by the control for localized formatting.
