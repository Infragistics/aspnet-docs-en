= SecureImagePipe Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0), each Infragistics ASP.NET control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.
