= Border Pane

The Border properties determine what the border of the Role will look like, including all borders, and top, right, bottom, and left borders individually.

*Border* -- Change the color of the border with the drop-down color picker on the left. The box in the center will adjust the weight of the border. The weight of the border is determined in pixels. The drop-down list on the right allows you to choose a type of border. Choose from many styles of borders including Double, Groove, Inset, and None.

*Top* -- Similar to Border, but affects only the top border.

*Right* -- Similar to Border, but affects only the right border.

*Bottom* -- Similar to Border, but affects only the bottom border.

*Left* -- Similar to Border, but affects only the left border.
