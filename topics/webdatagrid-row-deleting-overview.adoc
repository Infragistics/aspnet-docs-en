== Introduction

=== Row Deleting summary

The Row Deleting behavior provides deleting functionality for the  _WebDataGrid_  . As with all behaviors, the required client-side HTML and JavaScript are only rendered when the behavior is enabled. By default, rows are deleted by selecting a row and using the delete key. As such, you must include the Selection behavior for the grid and also set RowSelectType to be different than the default value - None. There is an option to enable a delete button to provide a more explicit user interface.
