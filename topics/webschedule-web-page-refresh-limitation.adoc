= Web Page Refresh Limitation

Users of WebSchedule™ applications should be aware that using the page refresh option within the browser can have unexpected consequences in one particular situation.

Specifically, if the user clicks the Refresh (

) button immediately after adding a new appointment, the appointment will be added twice to the system. The browser will display a warning message box to alert the user that the added appointment information is going to be resent to the server again (as shown below).

We recommend that users not use the web browser's Refresh button.
