= About WebExplorerBar

The WebExplorerBar™ control provides functionality much like that found in the Windows Explorer bar: items are contained in groups and each group may be expanded or collapsed. You can use each item or group to navigate to a URL of your choice, allowing for a simple yet effective navigational layout.

The following lists the various features of WebExplorerBar:

* *Data Binding --* efficient data-binding support to hierarchical data.
* *Load on Demand* -- Only load what is needed by end users.
* *Customizable Modes* -- Support for different expandable modes.

The following screenshot displays the WebExplorerBar control and labels its major parts.
