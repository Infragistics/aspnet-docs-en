= WebCalendarView

This topic will help you understand the differences and similarities between each of WebCalendarView's roles and how they are affected by the CSS cascade. The Role Description Table defines each of WebCalendarView's roles and the Role Inheritance Tree shows how certain styles are inherited from others.

== Role Description Table

Below is a list of Roles that you can use to style WebCalendarView. Each Role is matched by a class in a cascading style sheet (CSS). These classes, and therefore Roles, are governed by CSS rules. If this is not the case, the exception to the rule will be explained in the table below. This table will help you understand which Roles are inherited from which and how some Roles are unaffected by others.
