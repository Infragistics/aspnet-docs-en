Like all Infragistics ASP.NET AJAX controls, WebCurrencyEditor seamlessly integrates into the Infragistics® Application Styling Framework. With CSS based properties you can manually customize the WebCurrencyEditor by leveraging your existing style sheets.

WebCurrencyEditor also exposes a robust model within the client-side Javascript programming environment. The client-side object model (CSOM) consists of full-fledged properties and methods that enable developers to program significant units of functionality without the need of server-side postbacks.

Some of the WebCurrencyEditor control’s features include:

* *High-Performance* -- Lightweight markup and optimized code improve performance.

* *DisplayFactor* -- Applies a multiplier to the value(List of supported values : 1, 10,100,1000,10000,100000,1000000).
* *Min and Max values* -- You can easily specify the allowable range of numbers that can be entered into the editor.
* *MinDecimalPlaces* -- Allows you to set the minimum number of decimal places to be displayed when the control loses focus.
