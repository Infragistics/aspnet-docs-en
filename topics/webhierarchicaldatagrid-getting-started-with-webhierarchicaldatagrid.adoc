= Getting Started with WebHierarchicalDataGrid

== Before You Begin

WebHierarchicalDataGrid™ allows many features to be enabled for complex behaviors and dynamic operations. The most common use however, is to display data. Binding and displaying data with WebHierarchicalDataGrid is a simple process. It can bind to many forms of hierarchical data sources. One convenient way to obtain hierarchical data is by using WebHierarchicalDataSource™. For more information on using the WebHierarchicalDataSource component to bind to data, see link:webhierarchicaldatasource-getting-started-with-webhierarchicaldatasource.html[Getting Started with WebHierarchicalDataSource].

== What You Will Accomplish

You will learn how to bind WebHierarchicalDataGrid to the WebHierarchicalDataSource component using the Northwind Categories and Products table.

== Follow these Steps

[start=1]
. Create an ASP.Net web page.
[start=2]
. Drag a ScriptManager component from the toolbox onto the page.
[start=3]
. Drag a WebHierarchicalDataGrid control from the toolbox onto the page.
[start=4]
. Drag a WebHierarchicalDataSource component from the toolbox onto the page.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If you already know how to set up WebHierarchicalDataSource, set the component to retrieve the Categories and Products data with a parent-child relationship, and skip to step 26.
====

[start=5]
. Click WebHierarchicalDataSource's Smart Tag and select Edit Relations. The Quick Design appears.

. Click the Add View option.
[start=7]
. Select New Data Source from the drop-down list that appears.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If you have data sources readily available on your page at this time, these data sources will appear in the drop-down list. If you have multiple views in a data source, they are selectable in the DataView drop-down list.
====

The Data Source Configuration Wizard appears.

====

[start=21]
. Select New Data Source in the Child DataSource drop-down list.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
At this point, you can also select the first data source to create a self-related view. For more information, see link:webhierarchicaldatasource-creating-a-self-related-data-relation.html[Creating a Self-Related Data Relation].
====

[start=22]
. Repeat steps 8 – 12 for the second SqlDataSource, this time choosing the Products table with all columns selected.
[start=23]

.. Select CategoryID in the Child Columns drop-down list.

[start=24]
. Click Ok to return to the Quick Design view.
[start=25]
. At this point, WebHierarchicalDataSource is ready to use two SQL data sources to display hierarchical data. Click Apply then Ok.
