= Binding WebDropDown to a Web Service

== Before You Begin

WebDropDown™ supports binding to a Web Service using its  pick:[asp-net="link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.framework.data.flatdataboundcontrol~datasource.html[DataSource]"]  property.In this walkthrough, a simple Web Service is created with a method which returns the days of the week as a string array. This string array is bound to WebDropDown so that the days of the week are displayed in the drop-down container.

== What You Will Accomplish

You will learn how to bind WebDropDown to a string array returned by a Web Service.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
Building and designing a web service is beyond the scope of this topic. This topic demonstrates a synchronous way of retrieving data. For more advanced and data intensive applications, an asynchronous approach should be taken.

== Follow these Steps

[start=1]
. From the Visual Studio™ Toolbox, drag and drop a ScriptManager component and a WebDropDown control.
[start=2]
. Create a Web Service as shown in the following steps:

** Right click on the project and click Add New Item…This will open the Add New Item dialog.
** Select Web Service from the templates and change the name to myWebService.asmx. Click Add to close the dialog.
** Now add a WebMethod which returns the days of the week to the Web Service as shown in the following code:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Public Function GetDaysOfTheWeek() As String()
                 Dim weekdays As String() = New String() {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", _
    "Saturday"}
                 Return weekdays
            End Function
----

*In C#:*

----
public string[] GetDaysOfTheWeek()
      {
        string[] weekdays = new     string[]{"Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"};
        return weekdays;
      }
----

[start=3]
. Set the WebDropDown control’s DataSource property to the WebService’s GetDaysOfTheWeek WebMethod as shown in the following code:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
         Dim service As New myWebService()
         WebDropDown1.DataSource = service.GetDaysOfTheWeek()
----

*In C#:*

----
         myWebService service = new myWebService();
         WebDropDown1.DataSource = service.GetDaysOfTheWeek();
----

[start=4]
. Save and run your application. Your WebDropDown now looks similar to the following image:
