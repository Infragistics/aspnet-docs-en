=== Row editing behavior

The Row Editing behavior is an improved editing mode, designed to provide a better editing experience to the user. With Row Editing, the editable row displays all of the cell editors making it more apparent which row is editable. Also, there are new Done and Cancel buttons displayed in a dialog alongside the editable row. These buttons provide better control when committing or cancelling pending edits.
