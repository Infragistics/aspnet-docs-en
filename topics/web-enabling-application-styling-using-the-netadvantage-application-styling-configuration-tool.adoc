= Enabling Application Styling Using the Infragistics Application Styling Configuration Tool

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
Add-ins are deprecated since Visual Studio 2015. If you want to style your projects directly from within Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2015 you can use Infragistics AppStyling Extension. The whole functionality from the add-in is preserved and you can use this topic as a reference. To run the extension, open the *Tools* menu and select ‘Infragistics AppStyling Extension 16.2’. If you use previous version of Microsoft® Visual Studio®, you can still use the add-in.
====

Separate .vsix instalator is provided for 2015.2 and 2015.1.

Application Styling can be enabled at design time using the Infragistics Application Styling Configuration, which is a Microsoft® Visual Studio® add-in. This add-in allows you to control various aspects of Application Styling from one simple console. For more information, see link:web-netadvantage-application-styling-configuration-tool.html[Infragistics Application Styling Configuration Tool].
