= WebSlider Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics ASP.NET control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WebSlider™ Smart Tag contains the following items:

* Orientation -- Allows you to choose the orientation, either horizontal or vertical, for WebSlider.
* MinValue -- The minimum value of WebSlider.
* MaxValue -- The maximum value of WebSlider.

See the table below for a description of the items (e.g., field, drop-down list, checkbox), as well as the items' corresponding property in the properties grid.

The WebSlider Smart Tag contains the following links:

* About -- Clicking this opens the WebSlider product information. It contains information such as Status, Version, Expiration and Product Key.
