= Set Thumb Interaction

When you enable two thumbs WebSlider™, you can adjust the way each thumb interacts with each other. The ThumbsInteractionMode enumeration provides you with a range of options to handle the behavior of WebSlider’s thumbs in various scenarios.

Thumbs interact in several different ways:

* Free – thumbs are free to slide past each other.
* Push – thumbs will push each other when they slide next to one another.
* Lock – thumbs cannot slide past or push each other.

The following example code demonstrates how to set WebSlider’s thumb interaction mode to Push.
