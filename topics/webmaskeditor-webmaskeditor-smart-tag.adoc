= WebMaskEditor Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics ASP.NET control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WebMaskEditor™ Smart Tag contains the following items:

* Auto PostBack on Value Change -- Allows you to set auto postback options applied to ValueChanged event.
* Read Only -- Allows you to configure whether the end-user can edit the text of the control.
* Data Mode -- Allows you to set the type of object to wrap the value in the editor.
* Input Mask -- Allows you to set the input mask to filter the keyboard entries.

The WebMaskEditor Smart Tag contains the following links:

* About -- Clicking this opens the WebMaskEditor product information. It contains information such as Status, Version, Expiration and Product Key.
* Add Extender -- Clicking this will bring up a dialog that shows all of the control extenders that can be used with the WebMaskEditor.
