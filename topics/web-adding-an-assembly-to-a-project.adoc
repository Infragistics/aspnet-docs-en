= Adding an Assembly to a Project

Normally, manually adding Infragistics ASP.NET assembly references to your project is not required, since Visual Studio® is able to automatically add the appropriate references to the project as you place Infragistics ASP.NET tools onto the design surface. However, there will be times when you want or need to manually add a reference to an assembly to your project. Adding an assembly to your Visual Studio project is simple.
