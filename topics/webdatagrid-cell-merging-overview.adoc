== Cell Merging Summary

=== Cell Merging Summary

Cell merging is a feature that enables users to merge grid cells that have same values. The cells are merged only visually, i.e. the grid structure is not affected by the user’s merging action. Cell merging works on link:webdatagrid-sorting.html[sorting].

The two pictures that follow demonstrate a column with unmerged (left) and merged (right) values.

|====

By default, Cell Merging is disabled. For details on how to enable it, refer to the link:webdatagrid-enabling-cell-merging.html[Enabling Cell Merging (WebDataGrid)] topic.

If the grid is configured for client-side rendering, Cell Merging will be performed on the client. (The default is on the server.) For details, refer to link:webdatagrid-enabling-cell-merging.html[Enabling Cell Merging (WebDataGrid).]
