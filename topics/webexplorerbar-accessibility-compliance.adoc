= WebExplorerBar Accessibility Compliance

All of our ASP.NET controls and components comply with section 508, subpart 1194.22 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Below is a table containing the specific rules of subpart 1194.22 that pertain to the control, and how we comply with each rule. In some cases, you may have to set a property. In other cases, you won't have to do anything as our control does all the work for you.

|Rules|How We Comply with the Rules

|(a)
|All IMG tags, which have key functionality, have "alt" attributes property set or allow for setting of the alt attribute value.

|(c)
|The WebExplorerBar supports different styles reflecting the current group/item state (activated, selected, disabled, etc.) and while this information may be conveyed by color, it is the developer’s responsibility when styling the groups/items appearance for maximum accessibility to users who cannot distinguish color to use non-color style indications which can include CSS style rules for borders, font weight, font size, font decoration, etc.

|(d)
|The control's markup is readable without requiring an associated style sheet because of the attributes described in rules A and C.

|(l)
|When the control's scripts are changing the page markup, the new created content comply with the screen reader due to the attributes described in rules A and C.

|(n)
|When placed in form, all parts of the control are accessible using both the mouse and the keyboard, which includes expanding, collapsing, selecting, editing and navigating through groups.

|(p)
|A customizable "Data Loading" message is supported to allow the developer to notify the user about data fetching from the server.
