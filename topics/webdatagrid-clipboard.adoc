== Clipboard Configuration Overview

=== Introduction

Using the standard keyboard shortcuts of CTRL+C to copy, CTRL+V to paste, and CTRL+X to cut users can manipulate the grid’s data in the clipboard.

The Clipboard behavior is added to the grid like the other grid behaviors through markup, code, or the designer. The Selection and Activation behaviors are required to select cells for copying. The Editing core behavior is required to store pasted data over post backs.

=== Clipboard configuration chart

The table below lists the configurableClipboard behaviors of the WebDataGrid and WebHierarchicalDataGrid.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]

== Enabling Clipboard Support

*In ASPX:*

----
<ig:WebDataGrid ID="wdg1" runat="server">
    <Behaviors>
        <ig:Clipboard />
    </Behaviors> 
</ig:WebDataGrid>
----

*In C#:*

----
Clipboard gridClipboard = this.WebDataGrid1.Behaviors.CreateBehavior<Clipboard>();
----

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Dim gridClipboard As Clipboard = Me.WebDataGrid1.Behaviors.CreateBehavior(Of Clipboard)()
----

== Configuring the Cut, Copy, and Paste Functionalities Individually

=== Individual clipboard functionalities support

The copy operation can be turned on or off independently of the other behaviors. The cut and paste behaviors can be individually configured as well. In order to only allow copying, you must disable the cut and paste operations. All clipboard features are turned on by default when adding the Clipboard behavior.

=== Configuring the property settings for partial clipboard support

The table below maps the desired behaviors to property settings. The properties are accessed through the WebDataGrid’s Clipboard behavior. 

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to…|Use this property:|And set it to...

|*Disable cut operations*
|EnableCut
|_false_

|*Disable copy operations*
|EnableCopy
|_false_

|*Disable paste operations*
|EnablePaste
|_false_

|====

=== Example: allowing only copy operations

Allowing only copy operations can be seen in the grid as a result of the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Setting

|EnableCut
|_false_

|EnablePaste
|_false_

|====

For detailed information about these properties, refer to their listing in the property reference section:

* link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.gridcontrols.clipboard.html[Clipboard API Documentation]

== Copying Column Headers

=== Copying column headers overview

You can configure the Clipboard behavior to copy the column header information so that when the values are pasted into another application such as Excel®, the data is pasted underneath the copied header information.

=== Copying column headers property settings

The table below maps the desired behaviors to property settings. The properties are accessed through the Clipboard behavior.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to…|Use this property:|And set it to...

|*Enable column headers to be copied*
|CopyColumnHeader
|_true_
