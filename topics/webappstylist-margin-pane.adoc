= Margin Pane

The Margin properties determine how the margins of the Role will appear. The margins are located between the outer edge of an element and the border.

*Top* -- Input a positive whole number which will represent the distance in pixels between the top outer edge of the element and the border of the element. Use the spin buttons to increment/decrement the margin by one pixel.

*Right* -- Similar to Top, but affects only the right margin.

*Bottom* -- Similar to Top, but affects only the bottom margin.

*Left* -- Similar to Top, but affects only the left margin.
