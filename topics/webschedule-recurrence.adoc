= Recurrence

WebSchedule™ supports recurring appointments. These appointments follow a specific set of rules that govern how a recurring appointment will behave. You can enable or modify these rules by making choices on the Recurrence dialog, or by setting them on the appointment if you are creating the appointment in code.
