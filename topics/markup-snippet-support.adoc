= Markup Snippet Support

== Markup Code snippets

Our new release supports markup code snippets in Infragistics ASP.NET controls.

== How to Use Markup Snippets

Right-click on the desired aspx form and select Insert Snippet$$->$$ASP.Net, and then choose the desired snippet by double-clicking it.

When you double-click, for example, on WebDataTree™, the following markup code is generated:

<ig:WebDataTree runat="server" Height="300px" Width="200px">

</ig:WebDataTree>  

There is also a shortcut for every control, as a time-saving feature. For example, if you type “igdt” and hit TAB, you receive the same code as shown above.
