= Digital WebGauges

A Digital gauge represents values similar to a digital watch or digital alarm clock. Each digit within the value is rendered by arranging various “Sections”. A Digital gauge can be very useful to provide an odometer-like view to an existing gauge, or can be used just as well as a standalone.
