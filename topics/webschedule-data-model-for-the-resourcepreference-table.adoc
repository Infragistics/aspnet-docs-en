= Data Model for the ResourcePreference Table

The Activity table identifies a WebSchedule™ Activity or Appointment, and describes when and where it takes place, and how reminder notifications should be given. All columns correspond with .NET properties that have the same name on an Activity or Appointment object, unless otherwise noted.

Columns marked with an asterisk ($$*$$) in the following table are new or have been modified for the WebSchedule Data Model in Infragistics ASP.NET 2006 Volume 2 and later.
