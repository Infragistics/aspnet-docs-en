= Time Zones

An end user in Los Angeles adds an appointment at 5:30 p.m. PDT (Pacific Daylight Time). This is received at your web server in New York where local time is 8:30 p.m. EDT (Eastern Daylight Time).

How does WebSchedule work with this?

Your application must know the preferred time zone of the end user. Set the property on WebScheduleInfo™ to translate Los Angeles time to Universal Time (-7 hours when Daylight Savings Time is in effect).

WebSchedule™ views automatically adjust to the user's local time to display activity based on this time zone information. All times are stored in Universal Time within the data store.
