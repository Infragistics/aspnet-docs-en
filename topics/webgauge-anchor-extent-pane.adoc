= Extent Pane

The Spoke pane is used to edit the shape of the anchor. A depth value of 100 and a sweep value of 360 is circle. As the values decrease, the spokes become more visible.

pick:[asp-net="link:infragistics4.webui.ultrawebgauge.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugeneedleanchor~spokedepth.html[Depth]"]  -- Set this value to an integer from 0 to 100. This value is the distance between each spoke and the center of your Radial gauge.

pick:[asp-net="link:infragistics4.webui.ultrawebgauge.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.ultragauge.resources.radialgaugeneedleanchor~spokesweep.html[Sweep]"]  -- Set this value to an integer from 0 to 360. This value is the angular measurement of each spoke. The "spoke" appearance of the anchor is visible only when the sweep value is less than 100.
