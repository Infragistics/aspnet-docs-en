= Captcha Validation

WebCaptcha™ control provides the functionality to check its validation status on both server side and client side.

* On the server side, the control’s link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.editorcontrols.webcaptcha~validate.html[Validate] method is called automatically when the page loads. During this event you can also use the control’s link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.editorcontrols.webcaptcha~isvalid.html[IsValid] property to check if the validation was successful. You may also check the validation status in any other event by calling the control’s link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.editorcontrols.webcaptcha~validate.html[Validate] method and then checking the control’s link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.editorcontrols.webcaptcha~isvalid.html[IsValid] property.

*In C#:*

----
this.WebCaptcha1.Validate();
if (this.WebCaptcha1.IsValid)
{
    //add your logic here
}
----

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Me.WebCaptcha1.Validate()
If Me.WebCaptcha1.IsValid Then
'add your logic here 
End If
----

* On the client side, you can check the validation status by calling the control’s link:webcaptcha~infragistics.web.ui.webcaptcha~validationfailed.html[validationFailed] property. It indicates whether the Captcha validation has failed on the server.

*In Javascript:*

----
var captcha = $IG.WebCaptcha.find('WebCaptcha1'); // gets a reference to the WebCaptcha control
if (captcha.get_validationFailed()) // checks if the validation was successful on the server
{
    //add your logic here
}
----
