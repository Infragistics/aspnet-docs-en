= WebTextEditor Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics ASP.NET control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WebTextEditor™ Smart Tag contains the following items:

* Auto PostBack on Value Change -- Allows you to set auto postback options applied to ValueChanged event.
* Read Only -- Allows you to configure whether the end-user can edit the text of the control.
* Text Mode -- Allows you to set the text mode to single, multiline or password.

The WebTextEditor Smart Tag contains the following links:

* About -- Clicking this opens the WebTextEditor product information. It contains information such as Status, Version, Expiration and Product Key.
* Add Extender -- Clicking this will bring up a dialog that shows all of the control extenders that can be used with the WebTextEditor.

See the table below for a description of the item, as well as the item's corresponding property in the properties grid.
