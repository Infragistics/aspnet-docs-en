= Brush Elements

Due to the graphical nature of the WebGauge control, many elements participate in its rendering. Gauge has been designed in such a way that you have the capability to fully customize each of gauge's individual elements.

This high level of customization granularity has been achieved by leveraging BrushElement properties throughout gauge. Anywhere a BrushElement property is encountered within the gauge object model, complete control and customization can be applied to the element(s) it represents.

There are several intrinsic types of brush elements; each designed to provide a different kind of customization (e.g., renders images, creates simple solid colors, creates gradient patterns).

Gauge also allows you to create your own brush element and provide the painting/drawing logic that will dictate how an element is rendered. Understanding the BrushElement classes will allow you to customize the gauge to any extent.
