|Issue|Description|Status

|<<_Ref381785860,Row Editing Done/Cancel buttons missing at small grid height>>
|When the _WebDataGrid_™, _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_™, or a child grid within the _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_ have a height that supports displaying two or fewer rows, the Done/Cancel button dialog may not show completely because it is clipped by the bounds of the row container.

|Because of the way that Internet Explorer® 7 renders relatively positioned elements inside parent containers without relative positioning, child elements overflow the bounds of the parent container when overflow scrolls providing a broken visual experience.

== _WebDataGrid_

[[_Ref381785860]]

=== Row Editing Done/Cancel buttons missing at small grid heights

When the  _WebDataGrid_  ,  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_  , or a child grid within the  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_   have a height that supports displaying two or fewer rows, the Done/Cancel button dialog may not show completely because it is clipped by the bounds of the row container.

Workaround

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
You can configure the grid to have a larger height so that the dialog can display fully or you can use the Cell Editing behavior instead of the Row Editing behavior. You also have the option to always hide the Done/Cancel buttons using the Row Editing behavior’s link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.gridcontrols.rowediting~enabledialog.html[EnableDialog] property to keep the experience consistent.

[[_Ref381886973]]

=== Edited row not scrolling correctly in IE 7

Because of the way that Internet Explorer 7 renders relatively positioned elements inside parent containers without relative positioning, child elements overflow the bounds of the parent container when overflow scrolls providing a broken visual experience. Specifically, when a row is in Edit mode, scrolling the container will make the edited row overflow its parent container. This issue affects the  _WebDataGrid_   when nested inside a scrollable parent container without relative positioning.

Workaround

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If the  _WebDataGrid_   is within a scrollable parent container, you should ensure that the parent container is configured with relative positioning.

[[_Ref38188697311]]

=== It is not possible to move columns when the Row Editing Template is opened

When the  _WebDataGrid_™,  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_™, or a child grid within the  _WebHierarchicalDataGrid_   have a height that supports displaying two or fewer rows, the Done/Cancel button dialog may not show completely because it is clipped by the bounds of the row container.

== _WebDataTree_

[[_Ref381785829]]

=== No auto-scrolling when dragging a node outside container

When using the  _WebDataTree_   component with the Drag-and-Drop and Connector Lines features enabled, there are limitations with automatic scrolling. When a node has been dragged and you move the mouse outside of the tree container the expected automatic scrolling is not supported.

Workaround

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If automatic scrolling is really important for the project, a possible solution is to set the link:{ApiPlatform}web{ApiVersion}~infragistics.web.ui.navigationcontrols.webdatatree~enableconnectorlines.html[EnableConnectorLines] property to  _false_  . This will disable connector lines, but in that case auto-scrolling while a node is dragged out of the container, is supported.
