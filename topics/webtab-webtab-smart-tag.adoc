= WebTab Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics ASP.NET control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

*The WebTab™ Smart Tag contains the following items:*

* Display Mode – Allows you to set the display mode of tabs, such as single row or scrollable single row or multi row.
* Location – Allows you to set the location of the tabs relative to the content pane.
* Orientation – Allows you to set the horizontal or vertical orientation of the text and images of the tabs.
* Enable Close Button – Allows you to enable the close button on the tabs.
* Enable Add New Tab Button – Allows you to enable the button to add new tabs.
* Enable Moving On Client – Allows your end users to move the tabs.
* Auto Reduce Sizes of Tabs – Allows you to reduce the size of the tabs if all the tabs do not fit in the size of the control.
