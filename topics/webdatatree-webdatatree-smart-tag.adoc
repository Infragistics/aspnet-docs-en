= WebDataTree Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005/2008 (.NET Framework 2.0/3.5), each Infragistics ASP.NET control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears.

The WebDataTree™ Smart Tag contains the following items:

* Choose Data Source -- Allows you to choose an existing data source or configure a data source to bind to WebDataTree.

The WebDataTree Smart Tag contains the following links:

* Edit Nodes – Brings up the Edit WebDataTree dialog for adding , removing nodes and setting their properties.
* Edit DataBindings -- Brings up the Edit WebDataTree dialog to manage the data bindings of the control.
* Edit Template Collection -- Links to the template collection editor to add/remove templates that you can use in WebDataTree.
* About -- Clicking this opens the WebDataTree product information. It contains information such as Status, Version, Expiration and Product Key.
* Edit Templates -- Clicking this brings up all the available templates you can edit. You can drag and drop controls onto the templates and edit them as you like.
