= Overview

== Introduction

The batch updating functionality of the WebHierarchicalDataGrid™ control allows you to modify, insert, and delete rows without calling the server when switching to another row during the editing process: that is, the changes made exist only in the client and they are not is persisted to the server until a postback is executed.

The picture below demonstrates a WebHierarchicalDataGrid with batch updating enabled. Note that the modified rows (added, update and deleted) are indicated through a special style. Deleted rows also have an Undo button which appears upon mouse hover. This style indication will stay until the first postback to the server.

== Batch Updating Main Features

Following are the main features of the batch updating functionality:

* Modification of unlimited number of rows before the changes are persisted to the server
* Unlimited Undo capability (all changes made can be reverted) before the changes are persisted to the server
* Dynamic recalculation on the client if there are summaries enabled
* Support for client-side events
* Using the existing server events for updating, adding, and deleting rows
* Inherit batch updating behavior for child bands
