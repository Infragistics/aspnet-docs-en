= Multi-Language Support

The WebHtmlEditor™ control features built-in support for multiple languages through a simple setting of the  pick:[asp-net="link:{ApiPlatform}webui.webhtmleditor{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.webhtmleditor.webhtmleditor~localizationtype.html[LocalizationType]"]  property. With this single setting, the default text of all labels, ToolTips, menus, dialog boxes and drop-down list can be translated to a number of languages. It is easy to customize your own language files, because the language files are plain XML text files.

WebHtmlEditor provides built-in language files for each of the following languages:

* English
* French
* German
* Spanish
