= Reference the Control

There are two ways to reference the WebDayView™ control on the client-side. All of WebSchedule™ controls can use the ig_getWebControlById function and pass in the Id of the control to access it on the client. Specifically for the WebDayView, you can use the ig_getWebDayViewById function to reference the control.

The following code shows you how to reference the control.

*In Javascript:*

----
var dayView = ig_getWebDayViewById("WebDayView1");
----
