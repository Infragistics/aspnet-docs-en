= WebGauge Accessibility Compliance

All of our ASP.NET controls and components comply with section 508, subpart 1194.22 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Below is a table containing the 16 rules of subpart 1194.22 and how we comply with each rule. In some cases, you may have to set a property. In other cases, you won't have to do anything as our control does all the work for you.
