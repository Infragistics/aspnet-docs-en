= About WebCaptcha

The WebCaptcha™ control allows you to protect your applications against automated form submissions. It provides everything needed to ensure that the response is not generated by a spam bot and gives the application developer freedom to configure several protection modes.

* Hidden textbox protection for form submission
* Timeout protection
* Captcha images, generated from a dictionary
* Math-like and logical question-answer captchas, instead of just image
* Button to regenerate image, if image is not readable by the end user
* Ability to style the image – font color, distortion, level of warping , background color, size
* Ability to configure error message and default input box message
* Ability to hide default input box and point to another input box on the form that will serve as the validation
* Validation error message display
* Ability to configure case sensitivity
* Ability to configure length of the text
* Support for numbers and characters , not only characters

* Image recognition – instead of using letters/numbers, the captcha can show a well known item and ask the user what it is, or ask the user to select it from a list of items.
