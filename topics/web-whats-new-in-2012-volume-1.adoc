[[touch_support]]

=== Touch support

When the ASP.NET controls are opened through a touch platform browser, they react properly when the user interact with them, by processing touch events on the client. In addition to this change from the previous release,  _WebVideoPlayer_   adds special behavior, when it is running on a touch platform browser.

When running  _WebVideoPlayer_   on a mobile device, the default device video player controls are rendered, unless the Modernizr JavaScript library is undefined. If for some reason you do not have the  _Modernizr_   library available on your page, then the  _igVideoPlayer_   control is rendered, which in some cases may have fewer touch capabilities than the default device video player. That is why when  _Modernizr_   library is available  _igVideoPlayer_   falls back to the default device video player.
