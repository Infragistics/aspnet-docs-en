The StyleSet Properties tab in the preview canvas area allows you to tag your own Style Libraries with your own personal information. You can personalize each StyleSet contained within each Style Library. This information can include your name, copyright year, or even an end user license agreement, if you so desire.

To personalize a StyleSet, click the StyleSet Properties tab in the preview canvas area.
